# Guides

In this repository I collect “guides” of all sorts I write on various topics.
There's no overarching common theme or anything save for the coincidence I got
interested in a topic enough to write something on it.

The `en` folder naturally contains guides in English, while the `ru` folder
doe so in Russian.
